This is a a piece of software that allows for the use of a kinect v1 sensor with a computer to track the position of an infrared light source across the frame of view of a kinect v1 sensor and then translate that into mouse movement on a computer screen.

It also utilises a piece of arduino code to trigger the change on the pressing of a trigger (currently including safety interlocks due to the laser light source utilised.)
